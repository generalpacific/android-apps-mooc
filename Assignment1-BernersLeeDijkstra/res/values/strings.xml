He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,[3] and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet sometime around mid November.[4]\n\nBerners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the Web\'s continued development. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, and is a senior researcher and holder of the Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[5] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),[6] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[7][8]\n\nIn 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[9] In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[10][11] He was honoured as the \'Inventor of the World Wide Web\' during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium.[12] He tweeted \'This is for everyone\',[13] which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.</string>
